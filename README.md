# Skills Hub

A community-curated registry of skills. Each skill is submitted as a JSON file and automatically enriched with owner info, latest commit, and a security scan.

## Skill Directory

Each enriched skill lives as its own file in the [`skills/`](skills/) folder.

| Skill | Category | Owner | AgentGuard |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|

## How It Works

```
Contributor opens PR
  └─ adds skills/<skillname>-metadata.json
        ├─ name
        ├─ github_url
        ├─ category
        └─ description
             ↓
GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically
  ├─ ✓ Checks GitHub URL is accessible
  ├─ ✓ Fetches owner username, display name, avatar, profile URL
  ├─ ✓ Fetches latest commit hash
  ├─ ✓ Calls AgentGuard API → injects security report URL
  ├─ ✓ Stamps evaluated_at timestamp
  └─ ✓ Writes enriched data back into <skillname>-metadata.json
             ↓
PR comment shows enrichment preview
             ↓
Merge → enriched file committed automatically
```
